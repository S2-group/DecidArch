## Abstract
Software systems are increasingly being employed in people’s lives and society. They can improve, but also negatively affect the quality of life and interfere with human rights by, e.g., undermining the individuals’ and society’s values and causing ethical issues. To prevent such issues, software architects need to take ethical considerations into account at the early stages of design, e.g., when making architecture design decisions. Such considerations regard stakeholders, ethical values and their relations, ethical concerns, and ethical decisions. Addressing ethical considerations is especially difficult for software architects because of (i) the lack of training in ethics and philosophy, (ii) the existence of inherent ambiguity in ethical values, and (iii) the lack of methodological support in dealing with ethical and social implications of software systems, and eliciting and operationalizing ethical values.

This study employs a design science methodology for developing a card-based game (called Ethics-Aware DecidArch), helping software architects reflect on ethical considerations, and creating an atmosphere to foster inclusivity by supporting the values of different stakeholders when making group decisions. The game was played in four sessions, each including four professional software architects from two multinational IT companies.

This study presents lessons learned from playing the game through a participant survey and qualitative data analysis. The results show that the game helped software architects (i) reflect on different solutions for resolving ethical concerns, (ii) make ethical decisions along with providing reasons behind such decisions, and (iii) reflect on the operationalization of ethical values and their trade-offs.
